# My-favorite-tea

Very interesting task for [Volga IT](https://www.volga-it.org/).
The hardest thing for me - understand text description of animation. If I had had a reference, I would have spent less time for development. 

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
